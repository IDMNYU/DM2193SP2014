## Midterm Project - The speed bump in the middle

    Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.
        — Jeffrey Zeldman

### Overview

User Interface and Information Design Case Studies

* [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.com)

#### Redesign one of the above sites
You are charged with taking one of the most highly trafficked sites and redesigning it. This is not a coding midterm, this is a design project.

* How is the site used today?
* How might it be used a year from now?
* Does the content on the site work in the format is it in now?
* What are some simple changes that we could make to improve the overall experience for the people using the site?
* What are some big changes?
* Define an audience or a userbase for the site
* Identify common problems and try to solve them

* Topics to think about when working on your redesign:
  * Define your Audience
  * Identify problems / issues
  * Establish some goals
  * User Experience
  * Interface Design and Interactive Narrative
  * Information Architecture
  * Page Heirarchy & Composition
  * Accessibility
  * Above the fold vs. Below the fold.
  * Findability & Scanability
  * Responsive & Mobile First

### Deliverables

  * Midterm Documentation
    * Contains:
      * Executive Summary of your concept
      * Wireframes for three different views (Thurs)
      * Designs for three different views (Next Tues)
      * Any supporting materials to help communicate your ideas
        * Mood Boards
        * Click Throughs
        * Storyboards
        * Color Palettes
    * Examples:

      * Craigslist List View
      * Craigslist Item View
  * Use any tools you like to produce the wireframes and designs as long as they end up in Github in .PNG format
  * Print to PDF or produce separate documentation PDF, added to GitHub.

* Critique
  * Be prepared to talk about your work in front of the class.
    * You get five minutes to pitch your design.
  * Use the language and vocabulary above to describe your decision making process / design process.
