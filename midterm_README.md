## Midterm Project - The speed bump in the middle

    Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.
        — Jeffrey Zeldman

### Overview

User Interface and Information Design Case Studies

* [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.com)

#### Redesign one of the above sites
You are charged with taking one of the most highly trafficked sites and redesigning it. This is not a coding midterm, this is a design project.

* How is the site used today?
* How might it be used a year from now?
* Does the content on the site work in the format is it in now?
* What are some simple changes that we could make to improve the overall experience for the people using the site?
* What are some big changes?
* Define an audience or a userbase for the site
* Identify common problems and try to solve them

* Topics to think about when working on your redesign:
  * User Experience
  * Interface Design
  * Information Architecture
  * Page Heirarchy & Composition
  * Audience
  * Accessibility
  * "Above the fold"
  * Findability & Scanability
  * Responsive & Mobile First

* Deliverables
  * Executive Summary of your concept
  * Wireframes for three different views (Thurs)
    * Label sections for heirarchy and by class 
  * Designs for three different views (Next Tues)
    * Examples:
      * Craigslist Homepage
      * Craigslist List View
      * Craigslist Item View
  * Use any tools you like to produce the wireframes and designs as long as they end up in Github in .PNG format
  * Documentation PDF

* Critique
  * Be prepared to talk about your work in front of the class
  * Use the language and vocabulary above to describe your decision making process / design process.

* Self-Assessment -- [Email to me is due at the end of the semester](mailto:johnny.benson@nyu.edu?subject=[Midterm Self-Assessment] YOUR NAME)
  * Critically evaluate your **process** and how it is has changed over the course of the semester.
  * Describe the qualities of your process, what worked for you, what didn't. What you would change about your process.
  * Analyze the execution of your **project**: 
    * What was successful about it? 
    * What could use some improvement if you had more time.
    * How does your execution solve the problems well?
    * Think about the concepts covered in the course from visual design and interaction design to wireframes and coding.
  * Consult the [grading overview descriptions](../README.md#evaluation--grading) in this syllabus.
