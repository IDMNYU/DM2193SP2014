                    We learned about the history and introduction to HTML and other web development sources. We spent a lot of time trying to download the github application onto our computers. It is important that we got it because we can submit our files and also see other students' learning logs as well. We can see what people post and what we updated. I couldn't download it so I needed to wait for my new computer. Learning Logs was introduced.

            <p>Programming is acraft in my opinion because it is all about design and deals with the user's interaction with the computer. Everything is about being creative and thinking of new ideas that will make the users' lives comfortable. Software Engineering is not dead. It is just that it takes time to think of a problem and make sure it is solved in the best way possible. Making a web for example, it takes time to build, but once it is completely finished, the users will hopefully be happy to use them. Overall, the coding, the design, the creativeness, and the ideas must be creative in order for the programming and software engineering work.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We started to learn how to put learning logs in github. I am confused about how to set up the learning logs on the website. Since I did not have a laptop I can work with, I was trying to follow with my eyes, but I was confused on how to upload files onto github because I didn't have github. I see that there is a history behind HTML. I also see that there are many different kinds of browsers, but the best one to use is google chrome. Overall, by the end, I learned that the designer must design a web for the user, and the user must be satisfied with the web. The interaction between the web and the user must have a strong and postive connection.

            <p>I have learned that making mistakes is all part of the process of being a great successor. In order for us to learn better, we make mistakes. For the stack overflow, there were mistakes, but we learn from those mistakes when we debug them. Also, sometimes doing a process your own way is another method of learning.</p>

                    I learned about mapping, wayfinding, and teaching (cue for use ), and how they all relate to each other. I finally got my new computer, and I downloaded github. Professor Benson showed me how to upload files on github. We looked at different interfaces and websites.

                    We, as a class, saw different websites about randomness. During the show and tell, there was an interaction between the user and the interface. You use the mouse to slap man with an eel. Professor Benson showed us with a drawing as well as an explanation on how this interaction can be done. We also looked at different people's learning logs, so we can see what can be improved for the future. And also see what we are going to learn. We learned about the graphic design of the website so that it can be easily used by the user. There should be no problem with the user using. Becuase the user has a problem, the user went onto this website, so he or she can solve that problem. Our job is to help the user reach that goal. We looked at the cookie recipe and made many boxes. Our job is to re-create the cookie recipe ourselves.

            <p>I found the article about following a Web Design Process interesting. Because I am taking the class Ideation and Prototyping, this process reminds me about all the important aspects to designing anything for the user. It must be easy to use, greet the user, interact with the user, and make the user feel like the web is  person. The steps in this article are Planning, Design, Development, Launch, and then Post Launch. However, in Ideation and Prototyping class, there are four steps. Those steps are ideate (Planning), Build (Design and development), Test (Launch), and then instead of Post Launch, it is reiterate. It helps me to remind myself, "Is the user comfortable? Does this web interact friendly with the user?" These are the things to think about while developing a web.</p>

                    We did a couple show and tells once again. We reviewed some learning logs. Then we looked at some recipes that we had to do for homework. I still had to do mine because I have problems with Github and I am trying to figure stuff out. I tried to do it with the professor at the end of class. However, we still didn't find a solution. I will find a solution, but it will take some time. In the meantime, I have to manually upload the files on the Github site. After the recipe, we took a short Github quiz with all the tags and what their functions are. We went over it and uploaded it on Github.

                    On this day, we talked a lot about CSS and how to apply that in our index. We practiced coding CSS on a styles.css sheet. We tried different colors, headings, and fonts on our index html or the learning logs that we made. But mostly, we were talking about Order, Specificity, and Cascade. "Specificity is a type of weighting that has bearing on how your cascading style sheet (CSS) rules are displayed." (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/27/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/). It is a selector to determine which rule could be applied to the same element in markup. Also the order of precedence is also important. For example, if a page contains a link to two style sheets, the rules in the second style sheet listed takes precedence over the rules in the first style sheet. We will learn more about this as the class continues.

            <p>In this article, I learned about visual relationships. The web and other visual objects are all about design. It can deal with color, shape, and texture. Also the hierarchy of a web page is based on content, navigation, and supporting elements. In the end, I learned all the web pages and applications rely on visual cues to assess web interfaces. It also relies on an understanding of visual relationships with the users or people.</p>

            </h6>
            <p>I learned that even though you make mistakes, you have to keep going and keep your head up. Even though he had no idea what is going on and what he is doing, Jeff Spolsky and his programmers kept working on it and successfuly built a website together. Even though you do not have a plan, there is always a way to finish it.</p>
