      In considering my design for Craigslist, I wanted to get away from the list structure. I wanted to establish a connection between the community of craigslist users in the area. Instead of the rigid categories Craigslist has in place. A regional category generator is set in place so that the top most searched sections of Craigslist in that region are shown around the login button. My design also promotes the Craigslist login system and being able to connect to other users a lot easier.</p></b>

       <p>Once logged in, your profile name and AVI are shown in the top right with the ability to check your messages. What replaces the login in button is a save or “heart’d”  button. When you press this button the selected clickable go away and a map of your saved posted are shown. (Note the saved posts are already shown in the background)</p></b>

        <b><p>If we click housing, we're taken to a full map with clickable postings. If we hover over a posting, the ability to chat, email, and save the post appears. If users have attached a picture to their post, a preview is also shown.  </p></b>

       <p>The most drastic change to Craigslist in my design was the integration of the calendar. If we click rideshare we're taken to this view by default. If you have ever looked at the rideshare options on Craigslist, there is without a doubt a better way to organize. Calendars have become an essential part of organization in the workplace. It only makes sense to implement this onto Craigslist. I decided to create clickable postings listed on each day of the calendar. The ability to switch over to map view is in the bottom along side the rideshare button.   </p></b>

        <b><p class="img-desc">When thinking about full post views on Craigslist, I wanted to stay away from pagination in my design entirely. I did some contextual inquiry on Craigslist users and found that many didn’t like the feeling of getting lost moving from post to post. Many described it as “going through a maze.” Using JavaScript, a user can click on a post and window will pop up on the existing page instead of being directed into another.

          <b><p class="img-desc">Mock Ups </p></b>

<b><p class="img-desc">
After much deliberation, I decided to remove the “list” from Craigslist all together. It seemed an appropriate farewell since I have removed the list view entirely from the site. I wanted to keep some of the same colours. I kept the greys and purples, but darkened them. My goal was to make Craiglist look both simple and user friendly. My design aims to promote a community within Craigslist where users can chat and make connections.
