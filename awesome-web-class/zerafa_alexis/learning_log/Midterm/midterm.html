        When I set out to redesign craigslist I tried to keep one thing in mind; simplicity. When someone is searching for a specific product or service (as craigslist users tend to do) they want a strightforward and easy to use experiment. Not every element from the current webiste is horrible, for example the option of a gallery or list view is nice, so I kept that. I simplified the home screen and condesned the crazy array of categories into 5 choices. I also thought that it would be adventagrous to have a sort of messenger inside of the website itself becuase I’m sure buyers and sellers have to communicate in order to coordinate and meeting time and potentially discuss prices. The home page seemed a bit blank so that’s why there’s a hedge hog.

    <p>I wanted the home page to be as simple as possible. Having all of the categories laid out stressed me out, and I thought they weren't even categroized very well. I simplified and combined all of the categories into 5. I also created a search bar for your location to replace the nearby location links. I wanted to keep the logo the same becuase the webiste is still craigslist, just with a bit of a makeover</p>

    <p>When you click into a category, buy for example a gallery view of the items near you will pop up. I kept the option of viewing items by list gallery or map, and to the right of it I added buttons that let you proiritize your results by price, proximity, and how new the post is. The price appears in the upper lefthand corner of the image and only a short image description is visible.</p>

    <p>I think communication is very important on a website like craigslist. It seems inconvinent to make a person go outside of the site after finding a posters email in order to communicate with them. I think a live chat may be a bit too casual for the objectve of the site, so I decided to design a miniature in site email. Users can check their imbox which is set up just like a normal email inbox, and they can toggle between inbox and sent messgaes as well as scroll through pages via the numbers at the bottom</p>
