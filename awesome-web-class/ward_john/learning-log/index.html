                <p>In The Unproven Path, Joel Spolsky talks about how he abandoned his methodical method of programming in creating Stack Overflow, and he is nonetheless thrilled with how it turned out. How can it be, he wonders incredulously in the article, that he could do everything "wrong" and yet still have the project turn out right? I think one of the most important lines in the article was when his partner said to him "if Stack Overflow wasn't fun to do, he didn't want to be doing it," and that's possibly the most important aspect when really innovating.</p>

        &bullet; <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-engineering-dead/">Software Engineering: Dead?</a><br/>
            
            <p>To me, craft means taking pride in one's work. Being inspired to create the most elegant solutions to problems, rather than to just hack things together. Engineering makes do with what already exists; progress is made through craft. Jeff Atwood articulated this the best of the three readings. Doug Bradbury took a much more metaphorical approach in comparing software development to woodworking and other crafts and put forth the idea that with a craft, something might have intrinsic value separate from its usefulness. With software development, I don't see that intrinsic value as necessary for craftsmanship, though I think it is a possible outcome of craftsmanship. Dan North blatantly rejected this notion that craftsmanship is important at all and in fact even proposed that it is detrimental in software development.</p>
