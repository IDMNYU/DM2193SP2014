		<h1>Craigslist Groups</h1>
		<p>My midterm project takes the groups section of Craigslist and fleshes it out with a more navigable interface. The idea inspiring this project was the NYU Facebook groups hub, as well as the new organization administration software Orgsync, both of which make it dead simple to join a club as a student at NYU. My Craigslist Groups idea is intended to bring that same sort of centralization to post-school clubs, like book clubs and recreational sports clubs and LARPing groups and things of that nature. It works in the same way that Craigslist currently operates, with a group coordinator listing the group and people being able to view and respond to the posting. But the searching is better, since the original Craigslist does not allow a user to change locations easily, and it has location bounds which Craigslist does not have.</p>
