		To be taken into account and styled, my site wil be going through an overhaul

            <h4></h4>

				HTML -> XML -> RSS -> Blog posts
				Gotta sign up for feedly, it’s an RSS thing
				If you wanna be any sort of developer, you need to daily consume wtf is going on in the internet
				The star selector selects everything, generally though it’s inefficient and it’s usually used at the beginning
				Can be used as a stylsheet reset, to eliminate the browser’s stylesheet. It’s a good practice, 
				Can think of naming conventions in terms of object oriented programming
					It’s becoming a thing now, object oriented CSS
				What is line-height?
				What is box-sizing?
				How does float work
				He wont be here Thursday, MAKE THIS READING LOG GOOD and email him 1 question and yes this is week 5

				Misc.
				Hilary’s site threw mine in the dirt. I need to stop pretending like I’m giving it enough focus and actually put in work

				So I went onto feedly and found a post about angularJS. I’m not sure about what it is, but he says it can change a chart’s looks when the chart’s data changes, and that’s really intriguing! Here’s where the site is officially, I should revisit this as I learn more: http://css-tricks.com/using-angularjs-for-data-visualisations/

				Another thing I decided to do was revamp my learning log design. I can’t hold it back: Hilary destroyed my ego. I thought my thing looked nice, till I saw her design. Then I realized: holy shit that was garbage. But this was good! Now I’m motivated to better my design, to make something I’m going to truly be proud of. I can’t wait to get started

				Haha so it seems that using short hand actually resets the CSS to normal… gotta keep watch for that!
				
				I really appreciate the advice given by the article on how to become a better web programmer. It’s simple, and all things I knew already but refused to believe: knowing my history, realizing a majority of people are cellular users, respecting authority, etc. Hopefully I won’t just let this be another read, but I’ll actually put these tips into practice, I’d love to get to a website grouping event!
