				<h4>My first learning Log entry</h4>
	            <h5>Notes</h5>
	            <p> Just playing around with this for now, don't mind me. I'm still not entirely sure how sections really work but I have heard they are incredbily useful so I'm going to keep them here for now. I've got quite a few awesome ideas that I can't wait to implement. Perhaps I should write them down, or sketch them, or both but I don't really know.</p>
	            <h5>Reading Response</h5>
	            <h6>
	                <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2009/08/22/why-software-development-is-a-craft.html">PROGRAMMING IS NOT A CRAFT</a>
	            </h6>
	            <p><h4>My Response<h4>
	                Reading the title the way it was presented in the syllabus really touched me the wrong way. Seeing the word not associated with the craftmanship angered me. How could it not be a craft? But when I clicked the article to read more, and read the title then I understood. I agree wholeheartedly, 100% with the contents of that article. As a matter of fact, about a semester ago I was speaking with a friend of mine about my interest in software programming. When I was talking with her, I explained it in such a way that she had to comment and say "it sounds so much like your describing at art piece." It was at that moment that I began to think of it as such.</p>
	            <h5>Misc</h5>
	            <p>So my room the night before decided to flood. That was fun. Ruined a good night of sleep, and made me choose the horrid decision of missing my morning class to be able to function. BUT I suppose the other things that occured, including a possible room change are positive enough to warrant not feeling bummed out about it.</p>

			<p>JQuery day!~</p>
			<p>
				Basically a concept that makes JavaScript cross browser or something like that. For example,
				you couldn’t loop over an object in native JavaScript, but you can in JQuery. Seems we obtain-
				ed some JQuery cheat sheet but I’ve forgotten it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ohh, so JQuery allows you to change CSS in one go, with the .css property; that’s pretty nifty! 
				Sigh, I forgot I learned some JQuery in the past. This introduction, though very nice, is pretty 
				known already. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alrighty, so for my final idea I’m thinking pokemon battle simulator!
				Nope, nvm. The final site has to be something like a choose your own adventure. The web-
				site also needs to tell a story. There needs to be a mind map, with wire frames that link to 
				different portions of a decision tree. It needs to include PDF, Website, and be on the Internet.

				You've gotta sign up for feedly, it’s an RSS thing

				If you wanna be any sort of developer, you need to daily consume wtf is going on in the internet
				The star selector selects everything, generally though it’s inefficient and it’s usually used at the beginning
			</p>
			<p>
				Can be used as a stylsheet reset, to eliminate the browser’s stylesheet. It’s a good practice, 
				Can think of naming conventions in terms of object oriented programming
				It’s becoming a thing now, object oriented CSS

				So I went onto feedly and found a post about angularJS. I’m not sure about what it is, but he says it can change a chart’s looks when the chart’s data changes, and that’s really intriguing! Here’s where the site is officially, I should revisit this as I learn more: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/using-angularjs-for-data-visualisations/">click here</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Another thing I decided to do was revamp my learning log design. I can’t hold it back: Hilary destroyed my ego. I thought my thing looked nice, till I saw her design. Then I realized: holy shit that was garbage. But this was good! Now I’m motivated to better my design, to make something I’m going to truly be proud of. I can’t wait to get started

				Haha so it seems that using short hand actually resets the CSS to normal… gotta keep watch for that!
			</p>
			<p>
				I really appreciate the advice given by the article on how to become a better web programmer. It’s simple, and all things I knew already but refused to believe: knowing my history, realizing a majority of people are cellular users, respecting authority, etc. Hopefully I won’t just let this be another read, but I’ll actually put these tips into practice, I’d love to get to a website grouping event!

				Always want to place the resetting style sheet at top of page <br/>
				Shorthand resets the defaults not used, also multiple short hands<br/>
				Dozed off at vertical line explanation, gotta learn that<br/>
				HTML looks at spaces! Only one though, no matter how many eneters you put it will just read one space

				FLOAT! <br/>
				<dl>
					<dt>Affects the  order of the markup, works like inline block, doesn’t take up the full width</dt>
					<dt>You can tell things what to “float” next to</dt>
					<dt>Make me move to the Edge of parent, browser, or another floated element going that same direction
						<dd>STILL READ IN TOP DOWN BY BROWSER, allows for place switching</dd></dt>
					<dt>Gonna be making columns using float</dt>
						<dd>If all the children of an element are floated, the parent div will think there’s nothing inside of it</dd>
					<dt>Floating a parent forces the browser to encapsulate the child</dt>
						<dd>Or you can just overflow the hidden</dd>
						<dd>Forces browser into looking into the sizes of children</dd>
					<dt>Declaring a clear forces a line break at that point</dt>

				What would you ask craig, should you be given the chance? Well, I know I'd want to attract a younger demographic, because what I see here is hooboy garbage. Everything is circular. When it comes to my midterm I'm going to have to pay attention to the demographic: whose my audience? What people will be vising the site and what platform will they be using.
			</p>
			<p>
				What information architecture shall I use? I know Ambiguous organizations / sections, user error, rules not being clear, no heirarchy, and not being scannable are all bad things I'm going to need to pay attention to. However, some good things I know about are a site having to click few times to reach places, and high contrast to be visually appealing.

				JavaScript is a scripting language that is not compiled, but relies on Run Time. There are many objects in JavaScript, some of them being the Window object, the DOM, and CSSOM. Some nifty things to know are that === does not do implicit type conversions, and JavaScript can be used to dynamically change things. AJAX dynamically accesses databases. JavaScript is also used to create things like the lightbox.
			</p>
			<p>
				Homework is going to be to explore and use code academy to practice JavaScript, but I already did the classes ..
