            <h5>Notes</h5>
            <p>
                Well, we learned about Order, Specifity and cascading. Selector is something like body, cascade is that font property goes through the entire tree.
            </p>
            <p> Browser is reading top to down.</p>
            <p>What is this curlz font?</p>
            <p> If you have 2 body selectors in your css file, it will kill any duplicates in the first one and replace it</p>
            <p>
                K, now its time to explain that in my own words basically</br> Selector = Specificity</br>The most basic selector is an element</br>Gotta work on CSS daily, cant treat this like Spanish class</br>IDs are selected with # and classes with .</br>Good practice NOT to style elements or IDs professionally

                Buahahahaha javascript. the slut of languages XD I love how versatile this stuff will be, I remember my first application that I made. I created a javascript pokemon battling simulation. It worked! it looked like GARBAGE and felt like GARBAGE but hey, it worked well and demonstrated my skill with it, so p-off.
