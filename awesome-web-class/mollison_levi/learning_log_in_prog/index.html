        	<h4>My first learning Log entry</h4>
            <h5>Notes</h5>
            <p> Just playing around with this for now, don't mind me. I'm still not entirely sure how sections really work but I have heard they are incredbily useful so I'm going to keep them here for now. I've got quite a few awesome ideas that I can't wait to implement. Perhaps I should write them down, or sketch them, or both but I don't really know.</p>
            <h5>Reading Response</h5>
            <h6>
                <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2009/08/22/why-software-development-is-a-craft.html">PROGRAMMING IS NOT A CRAFT</a>
            </h6>
            <p><h4>My Response<h4>
                Reading the title the way it was presented in the syllabus really touched me the wrong way. Seeing the word not associated with the craftmanship angered me. How could it not be a craft? But when I clicked the article to read more, and read the title then I understood. I agree wholeheartedly, 100% with the contents of that article. As a matter of fact, about a semester ago I was speaking with a friend of mine about my interest in software programming. When I was talking with her, I explained it in such a way that she had to comment and say "it sounds so much like your describing at art piece." It was at that moment that I began to think of it as such.</p>
            <h5>Misc</h5>
            <p>So my room the night before decided to flood. That was fun. Ruined a good night of sleep, and made me choose the horrid decision of missing my morning class to be able to function. BUT I suppose the other things that occured, including a possible room change are positive enough to warrant not feeling bummed out about it.</p>
