                <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2009/08/22/why-software-development-is-a-craft.html">PROGRAMMING IS NOT A CRAFT</a>
            </h6>
            <p>When I read the first article "Why Software Development is a Craft", I became interested in his ideas and the metaphors he uses to describe how pragrammers do crafting. For example, I liked the comparison between a programmer and a furniture maker. It made me agree to his ideas throughout the article. When I read the second article "Programming is not a craft", I didn't realy understand the author's point, but I kind of get how he thinks programming and crafting is different. After reading all the articles, I noticed that there is a very thin layer of difference between programming a crafting. It's very negotiable.</p>
