            </h6>
            <p>When I read the first article "Why Software Development is a Craft", I became interested in his ideas and the metaphors he uses to describe how pragrammers do crafting. For example, I liked the comparison between a programmer and a furniture maker. It made me agree to his ideas throughout the article. When I read the second article "Programming is not a craft", I didn't realy understand the author's point, but I kind of get how he thinks programming and crafting is different. After reading all the articles, I noticed that there is a very thin layer of difference between programming a crafting. It's very negotiable.</p>

            <p>The article about Visual Organization seemed to be somewhat obvious. However, there were still useful guidelines in creating an ideal web page. For example, I thought the part about the top and second level navigation to be new ideas for me. The second article was interesting that it was an actual experience of the author. It was nice that he explains the seven princibles from his experience. As I finished reading, I think it is best to avoid mistakes before hand, but it is also useful to learn along while making mistakes in running blogs or other programs.</p>
