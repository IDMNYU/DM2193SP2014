            </h6>
            <p><i>Craft means to me...</i></p>
            <p>Programming is a craft as Doug Bradbury proposes. Like a blacksmith or an engineer, programming requires knowledge of various tools (languages and software) and using these tools to write efficient and proper code for a final product. It is similar to how a blacksmith uses iron to crate a hammer to crate other metal products; or an electrical engineer to design a circuit and let factory workers physically build the circuit. However, Dan North is correct that programming is becoming more dumbed down and crude. As compilers become more sophisticated, more programmers are tempted less to examine and understand their code than they are to get their code simply to work and let their compiler to handle the errors. However, I disagree with both that code is beautiful or ugly. Code must be both efficient and easy to read, since it is not only 1 programmer who will be reading and adding to the code. North values efficiency vs aesthetics while Bradbury values aesthtics moreso. They are both quite correct in some way. Tom Demarco is correct that software engineering is dying. However, it is not a bad thing. Craftsmanship implies striving to not only to deliver the best product, but to continue improving the product, always being the best and staying one step ahead of the competition.</p>
