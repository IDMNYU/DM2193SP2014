                </h6>
                <p><i>Craft means to me...</i></p>
                <p>Programming is a craft as Doug Bradbury proposes. Like a blacksmith or an engineer, programming requires knowledge of various tools (languages and software) and using these tools to write efficient and proper code for a final product. It is similar to how a blacksmith uses iron to crate a hammer to crate other metal products; or an electrical engineer to design a circuit and let factory workers physically build the circuit. However, Dan North is correct that programming is becoming more dumbed down and crude. As compilers become more sophisticated, more programmers are tempted less to examine and understand their code than they are to get their code simply to work and let their compiler to handle the errors. However, I disagree with both that code is beautiful or ugly. Code must be both efficient and easy to read, since it is not only 1 programmer who will be reading and adding to the code. North values efficiency vs aesthetics while Bradbury values aesthtics moreso. They are both quite correct in some way. Tom Demarco is correct that software engineering is dying. However, it is not a bad thing. Craftsmanship implies striving to not only to deliver the best product, but to continue improving the product, always being the best and staying one step ahead of the competition.</p>

                    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is useful for relating how the user interacts with the coder. It also clearly defines
                        what different coders need to focus on (i.e. HTML vs CSS) in the design process.</p>

                <p>I agree with Luke Wroblewski, that art and visual design is an important part of engineering. Visual heiarchy makes a site easier on a viewer's eyes and allows for easier navigation through the website. This in turn makes the viewer more likely to revisit the page. Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood's design decisions with Stackoverflow embraces this design principle. Stackoverflow has no needless images to clog up the page, and a popular answer to a question is already at the top of the page, which makes it easier to look for the correct answer without having to scroll through the entire page. The voting system also ensures that the top answer is more likely to be agreed upon by the majority, which makes it more likely to be the correct answer. It is why Stackoverflow is considered the one of the best, if not the most popular Q and A site for programming. </p>

                <p>The most important thing from the Tuesday lecture was the idea of HTML being a series of boxes encapsulated within bigger boxes. CSS dealt with moving these boxes around. Luke Reimer's steps are important to consider because without understanding your target's needs, your website will be ugly and frustrate the user. Wireframes deal with these boxes by assigning hiearchy to certain elements. However, efficient and readable code is extremely important as well, as noted by John Allsop.</p>

                        <h3><b>Order</b></h3>
                        <p>Order matters in CSS. For example, if you define body once, and then later again in the same sheet, the second will override the first.Similarly, the browswer will parse in order the CSS page going down.</p> 
                    <li>
                        <h3><b>Specificity</b></h3>
                        <p>When you create a class, you can use CSS to target a specific class and change its attributes or properties. It is important to efficiently target a class because you don't want your browser to parse through the entire sheet looking for that id, when you can target it immediately, especially when dealing with classes within classes. For example, .img .bg will look for tags starting with img, and then tags within img with bg. Instead of space, you can have logic operators like "+" or ">".</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3><b>Cascade</b></h3>
                        <p>Essentially inheritance. Tags will inherit their parent tags (tags within tags) unless specified otherwise.</p>
