                <p>Albert and Bernard just met Cheryl. “When’s your birthday?” Albert asked Cheryl. Cheryl thought a second and said, “I’m not going to tell you, but I’ll give you some clues.” She wrote down a list of 10 dates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>May 15, May 16, May 19</li>
                    <li>June 17, June 18</li>
                    <li>July 14, July 16</li>
                    <li>August 14, August 15, August 17</li>
                </ul>
                <p>“My birthday is one of these,” she said. Then Cheryl whispered in Albert’s ear the month — and only the month — of her birthday. To Bernard, she whispered the day, and only the day. “Can you figure it out now?” she asked Albert.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Albert: I don’t know when your birthday is, but I know Bernard doesn’t know, either.</li>
                    <li>Bernard: I didn’t know originally, but now I do.</li>
                    <li>Albert: Well, now I know, too!</li>
                </ul>
