                Developing software is a tiresome practice that drives the world in this fast paced, technological century.
                Those who can't appreciate how programs work obviously haven't coded anything past "Hello, World!" and should keep quiet with their criticisms.

                After reading the article about the founders of Stack Overflow, I realized that it is essential to have good programmers on your team.
                You can have the best analyst or best businessman, but in the end it is the programmer that will bring your idea intro fruition.

            <ul >
                <li>Instead of using width, use max-width for scalability
                <li>Box-sizing is great to use if you don't want boxes changing sizes everytime you change their padding
                <li>The different types of positioning are static, relative, fixed, and absolute
