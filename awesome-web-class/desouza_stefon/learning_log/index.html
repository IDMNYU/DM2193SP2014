    <h4> Reading Response </h4>
    <a href="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/visible_narratives.html">Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization</a>
    <p>
    I find it interesting how the author discusses the linguistics behind the visual hierarchy. It’s very cool to see the psychology behind these visual elements, and how different colors, shapes, and other various contrasts can have such a significant effect on a spectating audience. A lot of these facts that the author points out are very intuitive, but it was interesting to see him delve in it’s overarching psychology a little bit. I think the most helpful part of this article was the last segment, when he connected this information with web design. It became very relevant to what we’re currently learning, and has given me a bit more insight as to how important headers and titles, placement of captions etc.. are to the validity of a web page.
