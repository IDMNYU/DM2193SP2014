    I find it interesting how the author discusses the linguistics behind the visual hierarchy. It’s very cool to see the psychology behind these visual elements, and how different colors, shapes, and other various contrasts can have such a significant effect on a spectating audience. A lot of these facts that the author points out are very intuitive, but it was interesting to see him delve in it’s overarching psychology a little bit. I think the most helpful part of this article was the last segment, when he connected this information with web design. It became very relevant to what we’re currently learning, and has given me a bit more insight as to how important headers and titles, placement of captions etc.. are to the validity of a web page.

        The style of writing the author used to describe code was pretty unique. I always viewed code as this sort of mechanical machine; but with Bradbury's metaphorical analysis, code becomes more than that, it becomes a craft, a work of art. He adds a whole new perspective to code, which has honestly given me some encouragement to continually pursue this line of work.
