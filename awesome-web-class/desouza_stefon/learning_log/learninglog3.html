		<p> Reading Response: <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/22/following-a-web-design-process/">Following A Web Design Process</a><br><br>  
		This reading thoroughly explained in a very detailed and organized fashion, the steps needed to create an authentic website. For me, the first step (which is Planning) was the most important rule with regards to constructing a website. I realized that to create a great website, you can't just 'wing it.' You have to be aware of the roads you are going to take in order to proficiently bring your website to life, as well as envisioning what it is suppose to look like in the end. Coding is essential, but without a Site map, project charter etc., you are going to be wandering aimlessly in dark of your code, without a clear vision of what you are trying to achieve.
