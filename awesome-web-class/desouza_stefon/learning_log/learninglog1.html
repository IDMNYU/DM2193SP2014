		<p> Reading Response: <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2009/08/22/why-software-development-is-a-craft.html">PROGRAMMING IS NOT A CRAFT</a><br><br>  
		The style of writing the author used to describe code was pretty unique. I always viewed code as this sort of mechanical machine; but with Bradbury's metaphorical analysis, code becomes more than that, it becomes a craft, a work of art. He adds a whole new perspective to code, which has honestly given me some encouragement to continually pursue this line of work.
