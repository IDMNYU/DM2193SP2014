		<ul>
	 		<li> The original drive behind my redesign for craigslist was to make the site more easier to use, and to supply users with the ability to efficiently search for the information they want in a manageable and organized way. My biggest gripe about the craigslist website was that it revealed way too much information on the first page. My hope was to fix it's poor maneuverability and transform the interface into something that makes navigating easier. I added a few new features, particularly the map. I noticed that it was very difficult to find and establish your location on craigslist through the small links that were provided. It was especially inconvenient when you wanted to change your location, while you were searching, especially when the location you wanted was significantly farther from where you said you initially started. The map is now accessible while searching, so you can spontaneously shift at a moment’s notice, no matter where you are in the page. The last feature I added was the content page. When it comes to web surfing, especially with google, I find myself clicking on links that have nothing to do with the content i actually want. Sometimes the title may not be enough, so I formatted the offers in a way  that showcases the first few lines of the information, the title, and a small photo.</li>
