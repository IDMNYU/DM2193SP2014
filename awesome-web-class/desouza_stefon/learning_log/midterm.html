		<ul>
	 		<li> The original drive behind my redesign for craigslist was to make the site more easier to use, and to supply users with the ability to efficiently search for the information they want in a manageable and organized way. My biggest gripe about the craigslist website was that it revealed way too much information on the first page. My hope was to fix it's poor maneuverability and transform the interface into something that makes navigating easier. I added a few new features, particularly the map. I noticed that it was very difficult to find and establish your location on craigslist through the small links that were provided. It was especially inconvenient when you wanted to change your location, while you were searching, especially when the location you wanted was significantly farther from where you said you initially started. The map is now accessible while searching, so you can spontaneously shift at a moment’s notice, no matter where you are in the page. The last feature I added was the content page. When it comes to web surfing, especially with google, I find myself clicking on links that have nothing to do with the content i actually want. Sometimes the title may not be enough, so I formatted the offers in a way that showcases the first few lines of the information, the title, and a small photo. The audience of this website is generally geared toward those who love easy navigation and those enjoy visuals, and those enjoy navigating with maps. </li>

<p> Here the user is greeted with a map, where their location subsequently affects the results and searches that they receive. On a bottom, a "track" is present. When the user navigates from page to page, the page has a sliding animation as it moves from left to right. The 'track' remains on each and every page to track the progress of the user, and gives everyone the option to trail back and forth convienently.</p>

<p> Very simple and easy to use navigation system for categories. This significantly removes any of the clunk that was originally present in the original craigslist website </p>

<p> In this section, there is a map situated at the top of the page once the user chooses the category and the sub-category. The results that are present were determined by the location the user chose in the very beginning. Once again, the layout is structured and simple. </p>

<p>A "bread crumb" design is added to the map, where little notes are dropped to represent the different results in a specific location.</p>
