    The style of writing the author used to describe code was pretty unique. I always viewed code as this sort of mechanical machine; but with Bradbury's metaphorical analysis, code becomes more than that, it becomes a craft, a work of art. He adds a whole new perspective to code, which has honestly given me some encouragement to continually pursue this line of work.

    I find it interesting how the author discusses the linguistics behind the visual hierarchy. It’s very cool to see the psychology behind these visual elements, and how different colors, shapes, and other various contrasts can have such a significant effect on a spectating audience. A lot of these facts that the author points out are very intuitive, but it was interesting to see him delve in it’s overarching psychology a little bit. I think the most helpful part of this article was the last segment, when he connected this information with web design. It became very relevant to what we’re currently learning, and has given me a bit more insight as to how important headers and titles, placement of captions etc.. are to the validity of a web page.

    This reading thoroughly explained in a very detailed and organized fashion, the steps needed to create an authentic website. For me, the first step (which is Planning) was the most important rule with regards to constructing a website. I realized that to create a great website, you can't just 'wing it.' You have to be aware of the roads you are going to take in order to proficiently bring your website to life, as well as envisioning what it is suppose to look like in the end. Coding is essential, but without a Site map, project charter etc., you are going to be wandering aimlessly in dark of your code, without a clear vision of what you are trying to achieve.

        <li> CSS</li>
        <li> Three main things to think about with respect to HTML: Order (is parced from top down, Specificity (left <br/> of the curly brace, and Cascade ( if any of the same property code clash with one another, the code on the lower end will win, or override the other code ) </li>
        <li> Format for CSS: properties:value e.g.( font:courier)</li>
        <li> Full format: body { <br/>
                            font: courier; <br/>

        <li> Specificity is the means by which a browser decides which <br/> property values are the most relevant to an element and gets to be applied. (increases from top to bottom</li>
        <li> Cascading - Determines which styles are applied to a specific element,
