	    	the blue box in css provided a great way of understanding how web design really works and how css really works. it's all just boxes. this cleared up so much confusion of mine in terms of how things are laid out on the page, and manipulating the blue box in new and different ways seems like an ideal way to learn some of the many nuances to css.

	    	<ul>
	    		<li>many ways to hide objects: opacity, visibility, display and rgb</li>
	    		<li>visibility and display are generally the most elegant, opacity has its uses</li>
	    		<li>float is the best thing ever and will fix every broken page you make</li>
	    	</ul>
