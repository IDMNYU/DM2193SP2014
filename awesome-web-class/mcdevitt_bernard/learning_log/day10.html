	    	classical inheritance in javascript was a dense, but interesting read, and it helped to tie my knowledge of C++ better into my limited knowledge of javascript through the common practice of inheritance. javascript's system of multiple inheritance will certainly take some getting used to, but object augmentation sounds like an extremely useful tool to take advantage of in JS's arsenal.

	    	<ul>
	    		<li>reset stylesheets are useful for providing a blank slate</li>
	    		<li>different display techniques allow you to shape boxes on pages differently</li>
	    		<li>block will take up whole width available, inline only as much width as necessary</li>
	    		<li>float objects to put them next to each other, use clear to fix wrapping issues</li>
	    		<li>position absolute will keep an object in place regardless of other objects</li>
	    		<li>position relative will move an object relative to others</li>
	    		<li>position fixed will keep it static on the screen, even when scrolling</li>
