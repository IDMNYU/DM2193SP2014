	    	following a web design seems simple enough, but i understand that there is significance to every step along the way in crafting a site. going in a random order in terms of how you lay out parts, design and build the site can lead to a jumbled and unrealized idea, which could have been a success with the proper use of wireframes, designs and numerous prototypes. i know for a fact i will sin and betray this process numerous times but that's because my own way of working is a bit jumbled.
