	    	the discussion of visual hierarchy is really interesting to me, i particularly love the idea of controlled contrast between elements on a page in order to draw the eye without appearing overly dissonant. this is definitely something i see playing a huge role in ui and web design, as finding that balance between intrigue and repulsion is surprisingly delicate for a designer.

	    	joel spolsky's story about the founding of stack overflow is also extremely interesting. i have used the site dozens of times for help on various work, but never really thought about how it was designed. i guess that's a goal for a designer, for the idea of the site's design to be entirely disconnected from the site itself, which is purely an experience for the user to browse.
