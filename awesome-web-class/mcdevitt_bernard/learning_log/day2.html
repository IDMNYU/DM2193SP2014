	    <p>
	    	while i think the perspective that programming is a craft is an interesting one, i have to agree with the first article, "programming is not a craft", as i still see code as something utilitarian, and however interesting it is that programmers have taken it upon themselves to call it a craft, i don't see it as one. i feel that the definition of a craft has to be watered down in order to incorporate programming, but it all comes down to semantics anyway. i see a craft as a purely artistic endeavor, but some may see it differently. in the end i don't care that much, it's just words.
