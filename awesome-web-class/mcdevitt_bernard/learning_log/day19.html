	    	javascript is a really fascinating way to go about web development, it's actually a little amazing that html is so simple, but it all stems out into something as complex as javascript and jquery. i'm still totally lost on most of the utility of jquery because i haven't spent any time studying through it, but i know that the official website is sort of a crash course in it, and i hope to understand it a bit more so i can implement it on my final project.
