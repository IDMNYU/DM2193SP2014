My craigslist redesign focuses primarily on 2 problems I have found with craigslist in terms of ease-of-use and a unified experience. The first issue is the fact that craigslist has 2 ways to navigate its site (through search, and through the categories shown on the front page), but they are nearly entirely discontiguous, and there is no way to browse multiple categories at once, or search while filtering results by category. In order to fix this, I made the search and category features interdependent; a search result will display relevant categories and allow the user to filter using those, browse with all search results shown, or browse listings purely by category. 

The second issue I saw in craigslist was that it required far too many new pages to be loaded. Even though craigslist's current site is extremely lightweight, it quickly becomes tedious to open numerous results in new tabs, or backtrack to the front page to browse a different category. This required a more radical fix, and I settled on displaying all results through short pop-up blurbs on an interactive map. This displays the category a listing falls within, and offers a brief description of the listing, with quick links to contact the poster, view the full listing on its own page, or bookmark the listing for later. Bookmarked listings are saved within a drop-down menu in the upper-right hand corner of the window, allowing the user to explore the full range of craigslist without being bogged down by primitive design.
