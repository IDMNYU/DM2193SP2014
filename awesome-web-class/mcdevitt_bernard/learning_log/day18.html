	    		the codecademy course on javascript was vastly helpful to me, as it's difficult to understand exactly how to do what you want in javascript without some sort of crash course on what exactly it does. picking up jquery will be difficult as well, but it seems like an almost necessary addition to the language, like C++ to C.
