            <h4 class="response">"Programming as a craft" Response</h4>
            <p>Reading the 3 articles about programming being considered engineering or a craft initially had me sincerely wondering which it fit better. While programming is a learned skill, which requires similar discipline to traditional crafts, the issue of a logical progression in skill and payment from programming is probably the biggest boundary to cross if programmers hope to be considered craftsmen. Possibly because programming requires less schooling than any other major trade, there are no steps in the job progression of a programmer, and those unwilling to start their own projects will often get caught working as a "code monkey" with no significant change to their job for several years. In this light, being considered a craftsman is a huge advantage, as it would at least incentivize more discrete programming jobs at companies, and allow programmers greater progression in their careers. </p>

            <p>Aside from the possible advantages of programming being called a craft, however, it's really just an argument of semantics (therefore an argument about jack shit). As noted in Dan North's post, "all i have to do to associate myself with Software Craftsmanship movement is to <i>fill in my name on the website </i>." That seems to be all that this movement boils down to, a bunch of programmers saying they want to be called craftsmen. Okay. The job is still the same, though, and those who appreciate programming as a craft (or those who believe it to be purely utilitarian) are going to think about it all the same. It's just words, and even the possible job benefits of it being considered a craft will probably be moot anyway because, chances are, most companies will just continue seeing programmers and software as a means to an end as they always have.</p>

            <h4>"The Unproven Path" Response</h4>
            <p>Stack Overflow is the site I often use as a crutch to get through tough programming issues on whatever project I'm working on, and the story of its inception isn't surprising at all. Stack Overflow is a site that exists by necessity, just as there's going to be resources and communities for artists and engineers online, an organized community of programmers giving advice must exist. The interesting point of Stack Overflow's creation is that other communities did exist but it immediately became the most popular resource of its kind, due mainly to its eye-friendly design.</p>

            <h4>"Visible Narrative" Response</h4>
            <p>Some of the observations about visual design on the web in this article seems obvious, but I guess there's always a reason to stress the importance of relationships between elements on a page. One crazy trick to make sure no one ever wants to look at your designs again: take a bunch of ideas (good or bad) and put them all together on the same page with nothing to connect them. I like how the article stresses that you can have notable differences between elements on a page without creating dissonance, I feel like the most important aspect in designing anything is finding the balance between homogeny and dissonance of the parts that make that thing up.</p>

            <h4>Now Kiss</h4>
            <p>Like I said, I'd speculate that Stack Overflow's success stems largely from its visual design, which is invitingly simple and relatable. That's a huge achievement for a site by programmers, for programmers, and the popularity of Stack Overflow goes to show how important good visuals are for a site's mainstream success. I'd wager that most of the questions asked in the first few years of Stack Overflow's existence were already asked and answered in various threads on Usenet, BBS boards, and old programming forums. Stack Overflow ended up representing a logical step forward for the medium (the medium being programming questions), in which the content stayed mostly the same, but the context it was presented in allowed a much greater audience to take that information and use it.</p>

            <h4>Notes</h4>
            <div>Web stuff split into n roles</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Developer works on structure, performance</li>
                <li>Designer concerned with typo, look, feel, UX</li>
                <li>Business concerned with making $$$$$$$$$$</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Semantic markup matters for content, but generally not for UI stuff</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mapping: how things are laid out in relation to one another. Good mapping means the content can be topically understood by scanning the page without fully reading over it</li>
                <li>Wayfinding: understanding where things should be on a page without explicit information. Like putting the help icon under the snowman or some shit</li>
                <li>Teaching/Cue for use: P</li>
            </ul>
            <p>when designing, inventory types of pages. there has to be some kind of architecture to the content or else it's just a clusterfuck. Plan out architecture before trying to do too much crazy shit, none of the cool design stuff means anything if the site makes fuck all sense.</p>

            <p>a girl i met asked me to money match her in Super Smash Bros. i don't really feel okay with taking her money like that but she's insisting on it so i guess that's fine. the only money match i've ever done was with a 64-exclusive player over $1 for him (or the bic lighter in my pocket for me).</p>

            <h4>"Following a Web Design Process" Response</h4>
            <p>Seeing an organized process for putting a site together is honestly really helpful because it's so easy to get caught up in tweaking little aesthetic aspects of things before getting the wireframe/structure of it figured out first. I particularly like the idea of setting up the layout, making sure it works, then filling it with content; it's hard to focus on the framework of the site when the content that you want to add to it distracts so much since content is sort of the goal</p>

            <h4>"How To Read a Wireframe" Response</h4>
            <p>This is also super useful, it's actually ridiculously nice to see the basic layout of a site and how the content should be arranged, <b>without any content</b>. Probably the hardest part to grasp out of HTML/CSS for me is understanding how things should be structured on the page and it makes it infinitely easier to see these wireframes and understand how the layout of a site should be. Again, content is distracting</p>
