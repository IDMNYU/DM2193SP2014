            <h5>"Programming as a craft" response</h5>
            <p>Reading the 3 articles about programming being considered engineering or a craft initially had me sincerely wondering which it fit better. While programming is a learned skill, which requires similar discipline to traditional crafts, the issue of a logical progression in skill and payment from programming is probably the biggest boundary to cross if programmers hope to be considered craftsmen. Possibly because programming requires less schooling than any other major trade, there are no steps in the job progression of a programmer, and those unwilling to start their own projects will often get caught working as a "code monkey" with no significant change to their job for several years. In this light, being considered a craftsman is a huge advantage, as it would at least incentivize more discrete programming jobs at companies, and allow programmers greater progression in their careers. </p>

            <p>Aside from the possible advantages of programming being called a craft, however, it's really just an argument of semantics (therefore an argument about jack shit). As noted in Dan North's post, "all i have to do to associate myself with Software Craftsmanship movement is to <i>fill in my name on the website </i>." That seems to be all that this movement boils down to, a bunch of programmers saying they want to be called craftsmen. Okay. The job is still the same, though, and those who appreciate programming as a craft (or those who believe it to be purely utilitarian) are going to think about it all the same. It's just words, and even the possible job benefits of it being considered a craft will probably be moot anyway because, chances are, most companies will just continue seeing programmers and software as a means to an end as they always have.</p>

            <h5>Misc</h5>
            <p>have you ever seen a twitch channel that isn't very popular but the streamer has put in a ton of effort into ricing out the whole thing, with subscriber emoticons and stuff, even though the VODs have like 20 views? weird.</p>
