    <p>Floats are probably my favorite and least favorite property in all of CSS. I think it's super cool that you can wrap text around images, and create columns, and make (wait for it) HORIZONTAL menus!</p>
    <p>But at the same time, I hate floats because of the other problems they create. They collapse the parent elements, you have to clear them, and all these other silly issues that make me end up with a huge stylesheet. (I'm kidding... I'm sure there are at least 8 other reasons my stylesheets are huge. And one of them might even have something to do with a professor, who told me to style stuff by class names only.)</p>

    <p>Positioning! ACTUALLY my least favorite part of CSS. When I first learned about positioning, I avoided it like the plague. Actually, I still do. You change one small thing's position to relative and end up with a broken layout. Which is a problem for obvious reasons.</p>
    <p>It probably doesn't help that I have no clue what the difference is between absolute and relative position. They both give you access to the 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left' properties, and so I never know which one to use. Also, I have no clue whether to use absolute or fixed positioning for a background image on the html tag.</p>
