    <p>About all the quotes... I know I don't have all the best ones on here, but actually, I wish I had thought of compounding a list of all the best ones and making a website for them first. I bet I can find some people who can get a kick out of it! Oh, and that last one from today is about me. I do in fact stock up on Keurig's K-cups occasionally.</p>
    <p>But resumes! Aren't they grrrreat? I've seen a few really interesting templates, but I haven't heard from many people what they think of them. Everyone I know seems to use the most basic template they can find or come up with. And it seems that every person in charge of hiring has his/her own opinion on what they look for, which makes me think that at least half of it is purely luck-based. For example, apparently, a certain professor throws whole stacks into the trash. :D</p>
    <h3>Johnny Benson's opinion on resumes and references:</h3>
    <blockquote class="profQuote">"I've come back with a ream of paper like 'uh this is so sad' *poof* in the trash" - Johnny Benson.</blockquote>
    <blockquote class="profQuote">"Yeah he's a nice guy, we had class together on the 8th floor and he steals coffee." "- He STEALS?" "Yeah, but like it's just coffee, amiright?" - Johnny Benson.</blockquote>

    <h2>Thursday, April 23, 2015</h2>
    <blockquote class="profQuote">"If you have the lightboxes stacking up on each other it's cool cuz it's like the website is reaching out to touch your face." - Johnny Benson.</blockquote>
    <p>Lightboxes! They're actually really cool. And I kinda wish we did more exercises and built more things in class. Oh and the recipe thing. It was a really nice way to practice writing code that matches a pre-made design, which, in my mind, is one step down from coming up with a design from scratch.</p>
