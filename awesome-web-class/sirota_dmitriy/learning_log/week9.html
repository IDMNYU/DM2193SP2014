    <p>Class at Tumblr HQ! So aside from the "tour" of the place, basically we had a nice intro to Javascript. To be completely honest, despite the several courses in JS that I have under my belt, it's still one of my least favorite languages.</p>
    <p>See, the problem is that all these courses teach you basic JS stuff, but never anything about how to integrate that knowledge with actual HTML and CSS. In other words, I know what <code>var x = 5</code> is, but I don't know how to add a class to an HTML tag (or remove a class).</p>
    <p>But actually, I have a few cool web ideas that I need JS for (and php), so I really need to get on top of this stuff. Carousels are cool and all, but I have something much more serious in mind. (But it's a secret...)</p>

    <p>Why jQuery over straight-up JS? Makes hard things easier to do, code is more concise, less code to write, cross-browser compatibility, and utility.</p>
    <blockquote class="profQuote">Everything you deal with in JS is an object: an array is an object, an Oblect is an object, a function is an object, etc. - Johnny Benson.</blockquote>
    <p>I'm really feeling the whole <code>$('.className')</code> for searches, instead of having to write the whole  <code>document.getElementsByClassName("className")</code>. Less to write, and less to memorize. Also, one of my favorite things about using the jQuery search is that the same <code>$('')</code> syntax is used for all searches, with the only change being inside the single quotes.</p>
