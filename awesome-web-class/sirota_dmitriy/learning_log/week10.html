    <p>Lately, I've been noticing that my life is starting to revolve around coding. I have CS as my major, so the fact that there's plenty of coding to be done goes without saying. I also have this course, so there's more coding. And that web design side job I have literally means that I code during my school time, and I code during my free time.</p>
    <p>I guess it doesn't come as a surprise, therefore, that I'm beginning to see that typing into my text editor is becoming easier than typing into MS Word for most of my projects. And I'm not even talking about the ones that actually relate to coding. For example, I take notes in the code editor now for my Organizational Behavior class. I guess I just really like the fact that at the cost of an extra 5 seconds per line, I can format my notes and homework much more accurately with CSS than the default formatting of MS Word. And that's either super cool or super weird (depending on whom you ask).</p>

    <p>Not gonna lie, I actually typed along through the whole lesson, but for some reason (maybe it's my text editor or something) but the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> elements never seem to display. At least not when I write them. That having been said, the tooltip thing worked well when I opened the completed file that was presented.</p>
