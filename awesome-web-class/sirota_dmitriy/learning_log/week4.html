    <p>Finally learning about css... <br/></p>
    <blockquote>There are 3 things that come into play with CSS... Maybe we'll start there.</blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Order</li>
        <li>Specificity</li>
        <li>Cascade</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Specificity is a bitch. Well, not really... It just takes a bit of getting used to. <br/> Browsers parse CSS code top-down. The properties below that conflict with properties above will always win. Likewise, specificity comes into play: the more specific the selector is, the more important it is to the browser and overwrites other styles that conflict. So if for ALL lists you make them 2x as big, but for a specific list you make it 3x bigger, it will win.</p>
    <p>The most basic selector is an element. Any element.</p>
