    <p>Z-index is a property that controls depth. Basically, if you picture elements that overlap as sheets of paper, the higher the z-index of the element &#40;relative to the rest of the elements with a declared z-index&#41;, the closer it will be to the top of the stack. <br> Everthing with an undeclared z-index is defaulted to a z-index value of 0. The rest of the declared numbers are arbitrary.</p>
