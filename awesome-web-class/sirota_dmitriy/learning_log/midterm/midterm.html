            <h2>Design Concept</h2>
            <p>The first time I saw Craigslist &#40;about a month ago&#41; I was slightly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of links and other information to take in. And I grew up with the internet, so I can only imagine how much more of a chalenge it must have been to slightly less accustomed people using this site.</p>
            <p>My goal in redesigning the site was, therefore, to make it simpler and easier to navigate. I wanted users to be able to open the site, and get to where they needed, with as little trouble as possible. </p>

        <div class="wf1-text">
            <h2 class="desktopH">Design One: Home Page</h2>
            <p>The first thing I did was to remove most of the clutter around the main body of the content. The most important navigational elements have been moved to the top, along with the search bar, while the rest have been placed in the footer.</p>
            <p>The main body of the page has been de-cluttered as well. All of the sub-links have been moved further down to various parts of the page. Clicking one of the eight main links at the top will drag the page down to the appropriate set of sub-links. </p>

            <h2 class="desktopH">Design Two: Results Page</h2>
            <p>While there was nothing inherently wrong with the results page, I felt that there could be some improvements. Rather than a list, the posts will be displayed in a series of vertically stacked boxes. The topmost box will be an image and/or map &#40;if either are available&#41;, immediately followed by the title of the post, with the location taking up the last box.</p>
            <p>If there is no image or map to display, the title becomes the first box, and the summary &#40;now, a mandatory section&#41; becomes the middle box. Even though there will be a lot of text on this page, the framing of it forces the user to see it as more of an image, than a cascading list.</p>

        <div class="wf3-text">
            <h2 class="desktopH">Design Threee: Individual Post Page</h2>
            <p>When I first saw the posts on Craigslist, they all looked very text-heavy. All the text was in the middle of the page, without any real spacing and separations. This made the text hard to read and hard to comprehend.</p>
            <p>The new design forces the author of the post to fill in some required sections and then arranges them on the page in a much clearer layout. Images and maps go into the top-left corner, the most important post information goes in the top-right corner, and all the text begins right under that. The rest of the post information goes on the bottom, right before the page footer.</p>
            <p> This hierarchy allows the user to see the most important information, such as the overview of the job/post "above the fold," with the option to scroll down for the details.</p>
