    <p>So apparently, there ARE 13 weeks in the semester, not 12. Which also accounts for the fact that our learning logs have to have at least 26 posts in them.</p>
    <p>Bootstrap is pretty cool, but frameworks generally scare me. I feel like they're huge, and having to download a giant css and JS file (I think that's what bootstrap looks like) in addition to any styles you write is slow and excessive...? Although I hear good things about the <a href="http://unsemantic.com/" target="_blank">Unsemantic Framework</a>, and how it's all about being responsive. I guess the main reason I would need to use one is because I haven't mastered floats quite yet, and every time I try to build a responsive layout with more than one column, I end up needing 20 different media queries to stop it from breaking. </p>

    <p>And here we are, at the end of the semester. Probably the best part too: work is mostly done, and finals haven't started yet. Which is good because I'm expecting them to put up a fight this year.</p>
    <p>As for web design, I'm very pleased with my progress. Even though I only finished one job this semester, I managed to plug a bunch of holes in my knowledge. Which is good, because I now have a solid foundation to keep building on. You know what they say about building a house on an unstable foundation... Well, let's just say I poured a ton of concrete on that foundation this semester. </p>
