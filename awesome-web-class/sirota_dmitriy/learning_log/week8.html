    <p>Midterm presentations were today. I was a little &#40;a lot&#41; underprepared. Which sucked because I wanted some feedback, but I got none. Time to finish it and hope for the best &#40;hashtag yolo&#41;.</p>
    <p>Also, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but I suck at design, and my lack of confidence in this area is unparalelled. And at this point, I think it's less a 'lack of confidence' and more a general fear.</p>

    <p>More presentations! And hopefully some JavaScript, which I've been looking forward to.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px; text-decoration:underline;">JavaScript:</h3>
    <p>A scripting language that is not compiled. Something about runtime compilation.</p>
    <blockquote class="profQuote">"We literally need nothing to enjoy JavaScript. Except the console." - Johnny Benson.</blockquote>
    <p>So "==" is an equality check that DOES type conversion, while "===" does NOT do type conversion. So basically, <code>"2" == 2</code> returns <code>true</code>, while <code>"2" === 2</code> returns <code>false</code>.</p>
    <p>JS allows you to dynamically change web content, so long as the user agent has JS enabled. It makes the pages reactive.</p>
