    <p>The modal we made today was actually the first piece of Javascript I've ever written that was actually functioning and cool. Like I said before, all the JS tutorials I took before were pretty non-specific to the web. I may as well have been learning python or ruby, for all the good they did me. The only real syntax differences were the little <code>'var'</code> keyword and that in python you write <code>elif</code> instead of <code>else if</code>.</p>
    <p>I actually like how the code for the modal is all in the html, but it's turned off by default. I didn't know that that was a way to do it. I thought that the simplest way (and the only way) to do it was to create and then insert the element with JS.</p>

    <p>It may have taken me a little too long, but I finished my first freelance web design job today. Like actually finished. I think I put off doing the media queries for mobile screen sizes for two whole weeks. I kept telling myself that I had almost no work left, and that I could finish it off later.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I can't objectively tell if we did a good job on it or not... All the elements are there, and all the 'recommendations' were followed, but I still can't shake the feeling that I could have done more or done whatever was done better (if that makes sense).</p>
