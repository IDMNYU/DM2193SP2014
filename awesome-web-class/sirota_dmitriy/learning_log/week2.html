    <p>I found the article "Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization" to be quite interesting.. Not a statement that says much, but what I am getting at is that with the basic experience that I have accquired with HTML and CSS, I can put together a rudimentary page with semantic tags, and set some element properties that make sense to the reader.<br/> My problem is that I have no idea how to make a webpage look good. While I can put together a stylesheet, it's going to look pretty much like this learning log: the blocks of the site are separated and defined, but they look about as good as art made by a 5 year-old.<br/> So here is where the article comes in. It provided me with some useful insight on grouping information to direct users around the page appropriately. The tips from the article will be used to modify the layout of this website &#40;starting with this horrible font and color scheme&#41; and quite possibly the navigation &#40;although, I do like the buttons I made&#41;.</p>

    <p>The second article, "The Unproven Path," has a very different message. I can't speak for everybody, but I know that most people have a system they've developed over time that helps them work more efficiently. While that's all well and good, the article points out that sometimes it is better to drop the system in favor of a different approach. While the thought is unnerving at first, it can prove to be beneficial, as it allows you to generate work from a different perspective. As someone who has never planned work in any detail, this is something I've recently begun taking into consideration... As I mentioned before, all my previous attempts at HTML and CSS coding have come out looking terrible, and I guess that's because I never sit and plan ahead. I just start typing and see what comes out. Then I end up making an endless amount of changes, none of which seem to make it look any better. Well, that's all about to change.</p>
