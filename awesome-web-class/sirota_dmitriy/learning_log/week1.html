    <p>Actually, we didn't have class on this day. I remember this being unfortunate because I was actually really looking forward to this class. I'm not too big on the whole "Murphy's Law" thing, but it does seem suspicious that the more I look forward to something, the greater the risk that the snow ruins my plans (like a party I was planning on having, or a class I wanted to attend).</p>

    <p>So today we covered some basics of html. Learned about tags, elements, and 
    attributes. Oh, but before that, we had to all set up our accounts with GIT, which
    was actually pretty interesting, as no one really knows how to use the website 
    properly. But yeah eventually we got it to work. Then there was some business with
    downloading and setting up Sublime Text 3 and getting some plug-ins to make it work
    better. And yeah that's about all of it.</p>
