						<h2>First Blog Entry</h2>
						<h3>Fresh Start!</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>First day of web development. I had some experience with HTML and CSS previously. Excited to gain a deep understanding of web development.</p>
						<p>The first quote of every entry will be a random thought or a lyric that I'm listening to when writing the entry.</p>
						<h3>Software development as a craft</h3>
						<p>I believe software development is craftsmanship but only for those who go through the whole process of the product life cycle. One cannot simply just program, it requires designing and understanding the underlying concepts of programming. The raw material of programming is the language. It is best to learn software development through working on projects and from an experience person.</p>
						<h3>Difference between a pseudo class and a pseudo element</h3>
						<p>Pseudo classes select regular elements under certain conditions such as position relative to other elements or the state of the element. Single colon. Examples: ":visited", ":active", ":nth-child(n)"</p>
						<p>Pseudo elements create new elements beyond the document language. Double colon. Examples: "::after", "::before", "::first-letter"</p>

						<h2>Intro to HTML</h2>
						<h3>The aspect of Structure</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p class="thought"><q>I don't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road</q></p>
						<h3>Basic HTML Concepts</h3>
						<ul>
			                <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Element tells the web browser that the document is in html</li>
			                <li>&lt;h1&gt;There are 6 header types: h1 - h6</li>
			                <li>&lt;body&gt; tag defines the content of the page</li>
			                <li>&lt;a&gt; anchor/link tags are represented with 'a' and the attribute href defines the link</li>
			                <li>&lt;img&gt; tags is an empty tag and the src attribute defines the path or link to the image</li>
			                <li>&lt;span&gt; tag is use to apply meaning to a span of text</li>
			                <li>&lt;d1&gt; &lt;dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt; definition components</li>
			                <li>html tags with no content are called empty tags such as br</li>
			                
			            </ul>

						<h3>The aspect of Design</h3>

					<div class="content">
						<p class="thought"><q>Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder</q></p>
						<p>Different browsers parse and display HTML differently.</p>
						<p>Document Object Model is a programming interface for html documents. The HTML is represented as a tree and the DOM provides a way to access and change the structure.</p>
						<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) - developed for describing data, html is for displaying data</p>
						<h3>Design Concepts</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Narrative, design and interface matters the user</li>
							<li>Design
								<ul>
									<li>Look and Feel</li>
									<li>Palette</li>
									<li>User Interaction</li>
									<li>Info Architecture</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Mapping, way finding, teaching</li>
							<li>Div has no semantic meaning</li>
							<li>ARIA: access right internet applications is to make the web apps for accessible to people with disabilities. Example would be adding the role attribute to tags. </li>
							<li>Two reasons to use the attribute role is to override the role when there is no host language element that is appropriate </li>
							<li>The other reason is to back up a native element to support browsers that implement the ARIA role</li>

						<h2>Semantic Meaning</h2>
						<h3>Blocks, blocks, and more blocks ...</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p><q>It's all fun and games until ...</q></p>
						<p>HTML Encoding tells the browser what character set to use to display the page. Examples: UTF-8, ASCII</p>
						<h3>Semantic Concepts</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Rule of thirds and grid</li>
							<li>bold: stylish</li>
							<li>strong: semantic meaning</li>
							<li>inline elements: cannot have width or height set. respect left and right margins but not top and bottom</li>
							<li>block elements: respect top/bottom/right/left break line after block element</li>
							<li>inline-line elementsL: respect top/bottom/right/left, allows items to sit to the left and right </li>

						<h2>HTML5 and Wireframes</h2>
						<h3>Design before coding</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p><q>Don't say you don't time, say you have other priorities</q></p>
						<h3>HTML5</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>html5 is the newest version of html<li>
							<li>Have a quiz last class and I learned that tags that are inline and block</li>
							<li>pre tag: Preformatted allows you add text exactly how you write it </li>
							<li>Attributes have values are inside the closing tag</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Wire Frames</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Use vocabs for visual things such as image and videos</li>
							<li>Logo and branding has an X over the box</li>
							<li>Colors should have be applied to links, usually color is applied to the rest of the page during the design phase</li>
							<li>Hierarchy is important to a wireframe to how information is displayed</li>
							<li>Text should be ipsum or actual text</li>
							<li>Layout: consider whitespace and readability</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>CSS</h2>
						<h3>Presentation pleases the eyes</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>There are three ways of adding CSS</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Adding the style attribute to the tag</li>
							<li>Inline CSS: adding the style element to the html page</li>
							<li>External CSS: adding a link element to the html page that references an external CSS stylesheet</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Reset CSS reduces inconsistency between browsers by removing all built-in browser styling</p>
						<p>Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser consistent across all browsers</p>
						<p>!important tag specifies attributes that are crucial and must be applied regardless of other specificy</p>
						<p>Never use ids! By using ids you lose the cascading feature of CSS and your code becomes very specific and not flexible to changes. I use to always use ids to quickly add CSS.</p>
						<p>To center an element. Add width and margin: 0 auto.</p>

						<p>So recently I been getting merge conflicts on github and the file .DS_STORE kept coming up as a conflict. So I google what was file that file and found out that .DS_STORE is a proprietary and hidden file that stores custom attributes of a folder such a icon image.</p>
						<p>The rel attribute defines the relationship that the linked resource has to the document from which it’s referenced.</p>
						<p>I was browsing on facebook and linkedin and took a look at the login forms. I saw that the autocomplete attribute was set of off. I found out that it should be set to off to prevent unintended fill in such as credit car numberes</p>
