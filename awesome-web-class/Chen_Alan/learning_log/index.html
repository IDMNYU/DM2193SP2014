						<h2>First Blog Entry</h2>
						<h3>Fresh Start!</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>First day of web development. I had some experience with HTML and CSS previously. Excited to gain a deep understanding of web development</p>
						<p>I believe software development is craftsmanship but only for those who go through the whole process of the product life cycle. One cannot simply just program, it requires designing and understanding the underlying concepts of programming. The raw material of programming is the language. It is best to learn software development through working on projects and from an experience person.</p>

						<h2>CSS</h2>
						<h3>Presentation pleases the eyes</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>There are three ways of adding CSS</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Adding the style attribute to the tag</li>
							<li>Inline CSS: adding the style element to the html page</li>
							<li>External CSS: adding a link element to the html page that references an external CSS stylesheet</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Reset CSS reduces inconsistency between browsers by removing all built-in browser styling</p>
						<p>Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser consistent across all browsers</p>
						<p>!important tag specifies attributes that are crucial and must be applied regardless of other specificy</p>
						<p>Never use ids! By using ids you lose the cascading feature of CSS and your code becomes very specific and not flexible to changes. I use to always use ids to quickly add CSS.</p>
						<p>To center an element. Add width and margin: 0 auto.</p>

						<h2>Playing around with CSS</h2>
						<h3>Small things matter</h3>

					<div class="content">
						<p>So recently I been getting merge conflicts on github and the file .DS_STORE kept coming up as a conflict. So I google what was file that file and found out that .DS_STORE is a proprietary and hidden file that stores custom attributes of a folder such a icon image.</p>
						<p>The rel attribute defines the relationship that the linked resource has to the document from which itâ€™s referenced.</p>
						<p>I was browsing on facebook and linkedin and took a look at the login forms. I saw that the autocomplete attribute was set of off. I found out that it should be set to off to prevent unintended fill in such as credit car numberes</p>
