            <p><a href="http://journey.lifeofpimovie.com/">Pi's Epic Journey</a> This website is definitely one of my toptop favorites. It's fucking amazing. It's all one giant page and as you scroll, there's a crap load of animations and beautiful things that happen on your screen. I love interactive websites, so this is like a playground to me. When I discovered this website, I think the feelings I experienced was similar to holding your first newborn child in your hands. The film is visually stunning so it only makes sense that its website is too. Teach me how to do this</p>

            </h6>
            <p>Reimer's article convinced me how important having a process to consistently follow is for a web designer. Although I've had experience working with HTML and CSS most of my work has either been personal or working with people who I already had developed relationships with, and the article has helped me become more aware of the adjustments I would probably have to make in the real world working with clients. Allsopp's article delved deeply into the new developments HTML5 made in semantics. I started learning HTML when I was around 10 years old, when HTML4 was the standard and tables, frames, default fonts, < center > tags were all the rage. I stopped working on websites for a while and when I came back HTML5 was the standard so I had some new elements to learn and get used to. The updates that HTML5 introduced seem sensible and practical to me now that looking back at older versions of HTML makes me cringe. It's interesting that Allsopp is arguing that HTML5 has not reached the potential semantic capacity of HTML, and that there are still problems to be solved that HTML5 is not able to. As for the How To Read a Wireframe chart, I'm really glad that I learned how to in Visual Foundation Studio because I've had a habit of not wireframing and just diving into the visual ideas I already formed and I learned that wireframing is an important tool in website development.</p>

            </h6>
            <p>The Visible Narratives article resonated greatly with me because at heart I am a designer. I think that in modern technology, engineering and art are becoming more and more dependent on one another. I honestly don't believe you can make a successful product if you're lacking on either side. I also liked how the article discussed why aesthetics are important - to communicate and organize. Spolsky's article emphasized finding success in an unorthodox way. As the founder of Stack Overflow, he abandoned standards of business and software engineering. I think it's important to keep this kind of philosophy in mind. Just being good at what you do is enough to do well.</p>

            </h6>
            <p>People in technology have varying opinions on what software engineering entails. There are conflicts over whether or not software development is a craft and what exactly qualifies as a craft. In general however, the consensus follows that programming differentiates between those who are truly passionate and those who program for superficial reasons. I think programming is a craft because the process of software engineering involves design and creation. I also believe that the argument presented by Dan North relied heavily on his notion that most programmers are not masterful at their skills. Programming is a craft, but not all programmers are craftsmen.</p>
