            <p>The Visible Narratives article resonated greatly with me because at heart I am a designer. I think that in modern technology, engineering and art are becoming more and more dependent on one another. I honestly don't believe you can make a successful product if you're lacking on either side. I also liked how the article discussed why aesthetics are important - to communicate and organize. Spolsky's article emphasized finding success in an unorthodox way. As the founder of Stack Overflow, he abandoned standards of business and software engineering. I think it's important to keep this kind of philosophy in mind. Just being good at what you do is enough to do well.</p>

                    <li>XML is eXtensible Markup Language, makes arbitrary, unique tags</li>

            </h6>
            <p>People in technology have varying opinions on what software engineering entails. There are conflicts over whether or not software development is a craft and what exactly qualifies as a craft. In general however, the consensus follows that programming differentiates between those who are truly passionate and those who program for superficial reasons. I think programming is a craft because the process of software engineering involves design and creation. I also believe that the argument presented by Dan North relied heavily on his notion that most programmers are not masterful at their skills. Programming is a craft, but not all programmers are craftsmen.</p>
