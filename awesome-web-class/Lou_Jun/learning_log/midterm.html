    <p class="info">
        The idea of this design is to keep the simplistic idea, but also create an easy accessible and appealing design. The main page keeps almost of the contents that the original Craigslist had. The bar on the left side is always present on any consecutive pages. This is for utility purposes. Whenever they look at job or sale and need to know the answer to a question, there is the HELP tab. If the sale or job has a date, the calendar is present to plan accordinly. When a section is chosen, it will bring it to a page to see the available items being offered. Anything in sale is defaulted at Gallery, while other services will be defaulted at thumb. Finally there is the AREA option. The area option allows the user to choose the different places that offer items and services.
