            <p>Fatal mistake using ubuntu for setting up the github app. Spend majority of the class trying to learn how to download the github app lol</p>
          
          <p> just watched the first chapter and im using the chrome developer tools </p>
          
          <p> does it automatically update my index file? </p>

          <p> no it doesn't. But i can download it and save it with the same file name and same location and BAM saved on my computer. It's like my file was updated</p>

          <p> btw, 2 of the links are swapped </p>

            <h5>Reading Response</h5>
            <p> Programming is not a craft. I mean anyone can write code and it can work. But writing code that is effecient in using resources and runs in a timely manner is not programming. It is software engineering. One of the articles states that software engineering is dead, i say that guy has no clue what he's talking about. A programmer maybe considered a software devleoper but not a software engineer. In short, software development doesn't acct for effienct and effective code</p>

            <p> Learning how to build the learning log</p>
            <p>Semantics is a really cool word</p>
          
          <p> HTML has a very broad history and so much is involved. I thought we just sit down, open up our little sublime text editor and start writing code and BAM, we have a cool website. Such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                 But we have alot of stuff to worry about. Some web browsers maynot support or display our code correctly. We might have to go back and edit the whole code just for one browser, which  sounds like a pain.
                 </li>
                <li> i didnt know that there was a standard that the browsers</li>
                <li> Also learned divs are weird</li>

            <h5>Reading Response</h5>
            <p> The story about how stack overflow was created is really inspiring. I honestly follow all the rules. However, after reading the articles, i learned that breaking some of the rules may actually turn out to benefit u. I will start giving it a shot</p>

        <h4>My third learning Log entry for the awesome web class</h4>
        <section>
            <h5>Notes</h5>
            <p> building the website is like telling some sort of a narrative. Ive never thought it this way. Its a unique way of thinking it. </p>
            <p>There are 3 steps for telling the story:</p>
          
            <ul>
                <li>
                 narrative -> story
                 </li>
                <li> design -> rules</li>
                <li> interface -> organizational structure</li>
            <p> it was pretty cool and got me a different way of thinking of how web developers think.</p>

            <h5>Reading Response</h5>
            <p> I read the article on the design process. The article just expanded on what the professor discussed in class. The development part didn't introduce anything major to me, since im a CS major. The design project provided some major details to how everything worked. Now im just eager to finally learn some HTML.  </p>
