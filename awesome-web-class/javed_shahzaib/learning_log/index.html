            <h5>Notes</h5>
            <p> Learning how to build the learning log</p>
            <p>Fatal mistake using ubuntu for setting up the github app. Spend majority of the class trying to learn how to download the github app lol</p>
          
          <p> just watched the first chapter and im using the chrome developer tools </p>
          
          <p> does it automatically update my index file? </p>

          <p> no it doesn't. But i can download it and save it with the same file name and same location and BAM saved on my computer. It's like my file was updated</p>

          <p> btw, 2 of the links are swapped </p>

            <h5>Reading Response</h5>
            <p> Programming is not a craft. I mean anyone can write code and it can work. But writing code that is effecient in using resources and runs in a timely manner is not programming. It is software engineering. One of the articles states that software engineering is dead, i say that guy has no clue what he's talking about. A programmer maybe considered a software devleoper but not a software engineer. In short, software development doesn't acct for effienct and effective code</p>
