        <h1 class="title">My Redesign of Craigslist</h1>

        <b><p>Wire Frames</p></b>
        <b>
       <p>In considering my design for Craigslist, I wanted to get away from the list structure. I wanted to establish a connection between the community of craigslist users in the area. Instead of the rigid categories Craigslist has in place. A regional category generator is set in place so that the top most searched sections of Craigslist in that region are shown around the login button. My design also promotes the craiglist login system and being able to connect to other users alot easier.</p></b>

        <br><br><br>
       <p>Once logged in, your profile name and avi are shown in the top right with the ability to check your messages. What replaces the login in button is a save button where your selected saved postings get sent off to. (Will be shown later)</p></b>

        <b><p>If we click housing we're taken to a full non  blurred map (obviously) with clickable postings similar to what other people have done. When hovering over a posting the ability to chat, email, and save the posting appears. </p></b>

       <p>The most drastic change to craigslist I feel is my desire to implement the calender (pause for gasps). If we click rideshare we're taken to this view by default. If you have ever looked at the rideshare options, there could be a better way to organize them. I use calenders a lot at work and a lot users I know like the format.I decided to create clickable postings listed on each day of the calender. The ability to switch over to map view is in the bottom along side the rideshare button.  </p></b>

        <b><p class="img-desc">I wanted to stay away from pagination in my design entirely. I didn't like that you feel like your getting lost when you open a post. So when you click on a post a javascript window pops up instead. </p></b>
